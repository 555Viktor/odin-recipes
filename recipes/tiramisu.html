    <p>
        Tiramisu is a classic Italian dessert that features layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers and a rich mixture of mascarpone cheese, eggs, and sugar. Itâ€™s often dusted with cocoa powder and can be garnished with chocolate shavings. The name "tiramisu" means "pick me up," referring to the energizing effects of coffee.
